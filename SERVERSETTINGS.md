# List of server cache settings

Note: Settings are integer values. Booleans will follow normal js int values (0 = false, 1 = true).

- deleteinvoke - When a command is invoked, delete the message that invoked it.
- projectsenabled - If a server enables the usage of projects. This will only be enabled if the server is set up for project usage. This will disable when it is not (aka can't find project listing channel or category);
